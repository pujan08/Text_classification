# Text_classification
The code performs grid search to find the best parameters and accuracy for multiple algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees) using different feature extractors (CountVectorizer, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec), and then saves the results including the best algorithm and feature extractor to a text file.
